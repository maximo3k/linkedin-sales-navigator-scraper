# Scraper for LinkedIn Sales Navigator

This tool helps to export a saved search from LinkedIn Salesnavigator.
Somehow this function is not available natively and all solutions online are paid.

It is a simple script that helps to export it into a CSV file.

1. Install all the libraries necessary.
2. Enter your account ID, PW into the config.json
3. Enter the starting URL. It should be under the page where you search people with a filter and then create a list on the right side.
   The tool is not made for already made lead lists.

5. Run the tool, in the beginning it provides enough time to solve a captcha if needed.
